# Muse Iris — atelier booking app

Serbian-language ("sr-Latn") booking web app for **Muse Iris**, a one-master manicure/pedicure atelier. Master: Milena. Location: Žabari.

## Stack

- **Frontend:** Vite + React 18 (JS), `react-router-dom` v6.
- **Backend:** Node 22 + Express 4 + `pg` (raw queries, handwritten SQL migrations).
- **Database:** Postgres 16.
- **Auth:** single shared admin password — bcryptjs hash + signed JWT in an httpOnly cookie.
- **Container:** multi-stage `Dockerfile` builds the SPA and runs the API in a single container on `:3001`.
- **Local dev:** `docker-compose.yml` brings up Postgres only; the app itself runs via `npm run dev` for HMR.

## Local development

Requires Node 22 (LTS), npm, and Docker Desktop (or any local Postgres 14+).

```sh
# 1. Start Postgres
docker compose up -d

# 2. Configure env
cp server/.env.example server/.env
# Generate the admin password hash:
npm --prefix server run hash-password -- yourpassword
# → paste the printed bcrypt hash into server/.env as ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH
# → set JWT_SECRET to any long random string (≥ 16 chars)

# 3. Install deps + apply migrations
npm run install:all
npm --prefix server run migrate

# 4. Run both dev servers (Express :3001 + Vite :5173)
npm run dev
```

Open:
- http://localhost:5173/ — client booking flow (5 steps)
- http://localhost:5173/services — service catalogue
- http://localhost:5173/me — customer self-service ("Moji termini")
- http://localhost:5173/admin — admin dashboard (requires login)

The first server boot auto-seeds 9 demo bookings if the `bookings` table is empty.

## Production deploy (Coolify)

Point Coolify at this repo and select the `Dockerfile` build pack. Internal port: `3001`. Required env vars:

| Var | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db` — use the Coolify Postgres' internal hostname |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` | bcrypt hash generated via `npm run hash-password` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Long random string (≥ 16 chars); rotate to invalidate all sessions |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | `true` (HTTPS) |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` |
| `PORT` | `3001` (Coolify reverse-proxies this) |

On every boot the server runs pending migrations (`server/db/migrations/*.sql`) and seeds an empty `bookings` table. Both operations are idempotent.

## Features

**Client (no auth required)**
- 5-step booking flow: service → date → time → details → confirmation.
- Service catalogue at `/services` with per-card "Zakaži" deep-link that pre-selects the service in the flow.
- "Moji termini" at `/me`: reads per-booking access tokens from `localStorage`, fetches current state from the server, polls every 30s while the tab is visible.
- Customer can reschedule, edit the note, or cancel — up to **4 hours** before the appointment. Server enforces the same cutoff.
- Rescheduling a booking that is already `approved` reverts its status to `pending` so Milena re-confirms the new slot.

**Admin (gated by single shared password)**
- Login screen at `/admin` (no separate URL). JWT in httpOnly cookie, 7-day TTL.
- Dashboard: **Pregled** (overview) · **Zahtevi** (requests + filters + detail panel) · **Kalendar** (month grid) · **Klijenti** (aggregated client list).
- Actions: approve / reject / mark completed (subject to the state machine below).
- "Odjavi se" in the sidebar.

### Booking state machine

## Scripts

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start client + server (concurrently) |
| `npm run build` | Build the client SPA |
| `npm run install:all` | Install root + client + server deps |
| `npm --prefix server run migrate` | Apply pending SQL migrations |
| `npm --prefix server run seed` | Idempotent re-seed of demo bookings |
| `npm --prefix server run hash-password -- <plain>` | Print bcrypt hash for `.env` |
| `docker compose up -d` / `down` | Start / stop the Postgres dev container |
| `docker build -t museiris .` | Build the production image |

## Notes

- **Time zone.** Appointment `date`/`time` columns are tz-naive (Postgres `DATE` + `TIME`) and read as raw strings; the salon's wall clock (Europe/Belgrade) is the source of truth. Custom `pg` type parsers in `server/src/db.js` prevent the default `DATE → JS Date at local midnight` round-trip from shifting dates by a day in positive UTC offsets.
- **Demo seed.** First boot inserts 9 demo bookings if `bookings` is empty (see `server/src/seed.js`). Subsequent boots are no-ops. For a clean production start, run `DELETE FROM bookings;` once after first deploy, or replace the seed with your own.
- **`/api/health`.** Returns `{ ok: true, ts }`. Used by Coolify and any external monitor.
- **Single-master assumption.** There's one admin password; "Klijenti" view aggregates per `client_email || client_phone`. Multi-master support would require adding a master/user table and per-booking ownership.

## TODOs (out of scope)

- Real-time push (currently polled at 30s).
- Email/SMS confirmations & reminders.
- Multiple admin accounts.
- Phone-based booking recovery if the customer clears `localStorage`.
- Editing customer name/phone/email after the booking is created.
